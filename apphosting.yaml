# apphosting.yaml

# This file configures the backend for your Firebase App Hosting site.
# It's located in your project's root directory and is designed to be
# committed to source control.

# --- Runtime Configuration (runConfig) ---
# These settings control the underlying infrastructure (Cloud Run service)
# that hosts your backend.
runConfig:
  # Minimum number of instances to keep running.
  # Useful for reducing cold start times, but incurs costs.
  minInstances: 0 # Start with 0 instances to be cost-efficient if low traffic

  # Maximum number of instances the service can scale to.
  maxInstances: 1

  # Maximum number of concurrent requests an instance can handle.
  # Adjust based on your app's ability to handle parallel work.
  concurrency: 80 # A common starting point

  # CPU allocated per instance (in millicores or full CPU units).
  # More CPU means faster processing, but higher cost.
  cpu: 1 # 1 full CPU

  # Memory allocated per instance (in MiB).
  # More memory helps with larger workloads or complex data processing.
  memoryMiB: 512 # 512 MB

# --- Build Configuration (buildConfig) ---
# Environment variables available during the build process
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables need to be available at build time for Next.js
# Using plain values (not secrets) since these are public client-side config
